## ⚙️ How It Works

ScrollStamp v1 operates using a simple but effective approach:

1. **Position Detection** — Calculates current scroll position as a percentage of total page height
2. **Storage** — Saves bookmark data to Chrome's local storage with timestamp and URL
3. **Restoration** — Multiplies saved percentage by current page height to restore position

```javascript
// Simplified logic
const scrollPercentage = (scrollTop / scrollHeight) * 100;
// Later, to restore:
const scrollPosition = (scrollPercentage / 100) * scrollHeight;
```

## ⚠️ Known Limitations

| Limitation | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| Dynamic Content | Position may shift if page content changes after bookmarking |
| Lazy Loading | Pages with lazy-loaded content may not restore precisely |
| Single Page Apps | URL changes without full page reload may affect accuracy |
| No Message Context | Cannot identify specific messages, only scroll positions |
